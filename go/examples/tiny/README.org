* Tiny

This is a small but practical example of how to generate a parser
targeting the Go language.

The first interesting bit of this example is the build file.  You can
run the test suite with this command:

#+begin_src shell
bzl test --sandbox_debug -- //libs/go/parsing/examples/tiny:go_default_test
#+end_src

You are also encouraged to use the ~BUILD.bazel~ file in this
directory as a template when adding this parsing library to your own
code.  It shows how to use the command made available by the parsing
library within a bazel build with the ~genrule~ directive.
