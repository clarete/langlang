* Tiny

This is a small but practical example of how to generate a parser
targeting the Go language.

As this is just a teeny tiny example, we don't have a build system, we
just use tools made available in the go toolchain.

The test file ~tiny_test.go~ contains the line:

#+begin_src go
//go:generate go run ../../cmd -language go -grammar ./tiny.peg -output ./tiny.go
#+end_src

That is read and executed by ~go generate ./...~ and outputs the file
~tiny.go~ into the same directory as the test file.  Which becomes a
requirement to run before running ~go test ./...~.
