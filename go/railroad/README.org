* Railroad Diagram Implementation

** Overview

Railroad diagrams, or syntax diagrams, are intuitive visualizations of
formal grammars.

This package implements railroad diagram generation based on the paper
[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15834v1][Automatic layout of railroad diagrams]] by Shardul Chiplunkar and
Clément Pit-Claudel (EPFL, 2025).

The first phase of the algorithm translates the AST of the input
grammar into the following diagram language:

#+begin_src peg
 diagram d := "lbl"     // terminal
           | [lbl]      // non-terminal
           | (d...)     // sequence
           | (pol d d)  // stack
polarity pol := + | -
   label lbl := string
#+end_src
