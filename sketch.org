* Introduction

langlang is a parser generator and aspires to provide a toolbox for
interacting with computer languages in a more general way.

The core piece, and the only thing that is described in the roadmap is
the top-down parser generator (based on Parsing Expression Grammars)
that is rather feature rich and strives to be as minimal and elegant
as possible, without losing sight of performance.

To shape the core piece, and enrich the tooling around extracting and
manipulating the meaning of text and structured data, other algorithms
and tools will be written along the way.  The [[Rambling]] section
contains some of the ideas about what could be built.  And once these
ideas get enough shape, they become implementation designs and get
implemented.

** Capturing Values

Matches of an input against a grammar will produce an output tree.
Currently, the Virtual Machine captures all values successfully
matched by default and store them in a stack that is separate from the
stack used in the **Production Call** and **Backtracking** mechanisms.

The machine pushes a frame onto the capture stack before it starts
looping through the bytecode.  Opcodes that implement matching of
terminals (~Any~, ~Char~, ~Span~) push matched values onto the current
capture stack frame.  A capture stack frame contains a vector of
captured values and an index that tracks which capture values have
been committed.

When popping a backtrack frame from the stack, the ~Fail~ instruction
will drain the values not committed from the frame on top of the
capture stack.  That's how backtracking the *values* captured within
the same frame is implemented.  Notice that the ~Fail~ instruction
also pops frames off the capture stack when it pops a call frame from
the main stack to keep it ballanced with the capture frame pushed by
the opcode ~Call~ that's popped by ~Return~ when there's no failure.

The ~Return~ instruction will pop the frame on top of the capture
stack, wrap all its captures in a ~Value::Node~ with the name of the
production and its captured values.

In order to support left recursive calls, the ~Call~ instruction will
commit all captured values before trying to increment the left
recursive bound (rule ~inc.1~).  And ~Call~ that has successfully
incremented the left recursive bound will also pop all currently
commited values of the frame on the top of the capture stack and wrap
them in a ~Value::Node~ to be pushed onto the same frame (rule
~lvar.4~).

Code for both ~Optional~ (~?~) and ~ZeroOrMore~ (~*~) operators is
emitted surrounded by a pair of ~CapPush~ and ~CapPop~ instructions,
and have a ~CapCommit~ instruction that executes after the whole
operation is done, upon (handled) failure or success.

As mentioned, by default all matched values are captured. Notice that
predicates ~NOT~ and ~AND~ don't consume any input, so there are no
values to be captured from their successful match.  There are two
operations that might not move the cursor, the ~STAR~ (~*~) and the
~OPTIONAL~ (~?~) operators, as they never fail even when the input
doesn't match.

Read along to see how one can also transform captured values after
they match and before they're returned.

** Semantic Action Expressions
*** Use Cases

1. 
    #+begin_src peg
      Identifier <- IdentStart IdentCont*
      IdentStart <- [a-zA-Z_]
      IdentCont  <- IdentStart / [0-9]
      Identifier -> text()
    #+end_src
2. 
    #+begin_src peg
      Unary   <- [+-] Unary / Decimal
      Decimal <- Digit+
      Digit   <- [0-9]

      @nowrap{*}
      Unary '+' v -> +v
      Unary '-' v -> -v
      Unary       -> i32(text(), 10)
    #+end_src
3. 
    #+begin_src peg
      expr <- expr¹ '+' expr²
            / expr¹ '-' expr²
            / expr² '*' expr³
            / expr² '/' expr³
            / dec
      dec  <- ([1-9][0-9]* / '0')

      @nowrap{*}
      expr a '+' b -> a + b
      expr a '-' b -> a - b
      expr a '*' b -> a * b
      expr a '/' b -> a / b
      expr         -> i32(text(), 10)
    #+end_src
4. 


*** Transform captured values

Often enough, a value captured from a given production needs to be
transformed before it is useful.  Take the the following grammar for
example (snippet extracted from ~peg.peg~)

#+begin_src peg
  Identifier <- IdentStart IdentCont*
  IdentStart <- [a-zA-Z_]
  IdentCont  <- IdentStart / [0-9]
#+end_src

If given the input ~Text~ it will yield the following result:

#+begin_src peg
  Identifier: [
      IdentStart: [
          "T"
      ]
      IdentCont: [
          IdentStart: [
              "e"
          ]
      ]
      IdentCont: [
          IdentStart: [
              "x"
          ]
      ]
      IdentCont: [
          IdentStart: [
              "t"
          ]
      ]
  ]
#+end_src

That looks a little too verbose of an output.  Ideally, we would want
something more along these lines:

#+begin_src peg
  Identifier: ["Text"]
#+end_src

The output above has suppressed the wrapping of the matching of both
~IdentStart~ and ~IdentCont~.  That can be achieved by the following
semantic action expressions:

#+begin_src peg
  Identifier -> text()
  IdentStart -> unwrapped(text())
  IdentCont  -> unwrapped(text())
#+end_src

Notice the arrow points at the right hand side instead of pointing at
the left hand side, like when we're defining regular productions.  And
these *Semantic Action Expressions* can contain values of any type
supported by the matching machine. That includes numbers, chars,
strings, lists, and nodes.  It can also contain function calls.  These
functions are all built in and help transforming the output of the
matched value.  The function ~unwrapped()~ will prevent the capture
values of a role from being wrapped in a named ~Value::Node~.

*** Signature of expressions

In PEGs, it is rather common for productions to return alternatives
with different arity.  Take the following grammar as an example:

#+begin_src peg
  Unary   <- [+-] Unary / Decimal
  Decimal <- Digit+
  Digit   <- [0-9]
#+end_src

The rule ~Digit~ returns a single character (arity == 1).  The rule
~Decimel~ returns one or more digits (arity >= 1).  The arity of the
rule ~Unary~ can either be 1 or 2.  The first alternative of the
ordered choice will return first either the plus or minus sign and
then match.




#+begin_src peg
  expr <- expr¹ '+' expr²
        / expr¹ '-' expr²
        / expr² '*' expr³
        / expr² '/' expr³
        / dec
  dec  <- ([1-9][0-9]* / '0')

  expr a '+' b -> a + b
  expr a '-' b -> a - b
  expr a '*' b -> a * b
  expr a '/' b -> a / b
  expr d       -> i64(join(d), 10)


# Attempt#2
# expr(a '+' b) -> a + b
# expr(a '-' b) -> a - b
# expr(a '*' b) -> a * b
# expr(a '/' b) -> a / b
# expr(d) -> i64(join(d), 10)

# Attempt#3
# expr|a '+' b| -> a + b
# expr|a '-' b| -> a - b
# expr|a '*' b| -> a * b
# expr|a '/' b| -> a / b
# expr|d|       -> i64(join(d), 10)

#+end_src

*** Stuff
When a production matches an input successfully, the matched values
are captured into a tree with the structure defined by the matched
expression against the grammar.  More concretely, captures are of the
type ~langlang_lib::vm::Value~, and a successful string match returns
the variants ~Value::Str(s)~ or ~Value::Chr(c)~ when matching terminal
productions, and ~Value::Node~ when non-terminal productions are
matched.  e.g.:

#+begin_src peg
Digit <- [0-9]
#+end_src

If the above grammar is matched against the following input:

#+begin_src text
4
#+end_src

The output tree will have a single node with the following format:

#+begin_src rust
  Value::Node {
      name: "Digit".to_string(),
      items: vec![
          Value::Chr('4'),
      ],
  }
#+end_src

The following expression can be used to transform the above value in a
64bit signed integer:

#+begin_src peg
Digit _ -> unwrapped(i64(text(), 10))
#+end_src

Going step by step on the execution of the above expression, ~text()~
is the first function to be executed, and takes the entire vector of
items from within the `Node` above.  It returns




A slightly more sophisticated rule for parsing decimals will instead 

#+begin_src peg
Decimal <- '0' / [1-9][0-9]*
#+end_src

There are types for characters,
strings, decimal numbers, and floats, but the subject of arity bundles
all these types under the arity of one 1.  E.g.:

That returns a single ~vm::Value::Chr('5')~ instance when matched
against the input ~5~.

Let's look at a more complex expression for parsing decimal numbers:

#+begin_src peg
Decimal <- '0' / [1-9][0-9]*
#+end_src

What can we say about the shape of its return? It obviously depends on
the input, but it also depends on the arity of each sub-expression.

Let's go over an example.  If the above expression tries to match
against ~0~, the above expression returns a ~vm::Value::Chr(0)~.

If the input is a single digit from ~1~ to ~9~, it will match it, and
the zero-or-more operation that happens at the end of the expression
will exit without matching.

then it will try to match zero or more digits from ~0~ to ~9~.

#+begin_src text

  Empty -> ()
  And   -> ()
  Not   -> ()

  Any   -> Chr
  Char  -> Chr
  Range -> Chr
  Str   -> Str

  Choice   A B -> A OR B
  Optional   E -> X OR ()
  ZeroOrMore E -> Vec<E>
  OneOrMore  E -> Vec<E>
  Identifier N -> Node<N>

#+end_src

** Error Handling

In the original definition of Parsing Expression Grammars,
backtracking is used to reset the input cursor to where it was before
trying a different parsing expression.  If there is no match, the
backtracking fails and the cursor is left at the position it was at
the beginning of the last *Ordered Choice*.

To improve error reporting, there's a heuristic called the *Farther
Failure Position* that introduces a new register in the Virtual
Machine to keep track of the cursor up to the last successful match
that is immune to backtracking.  With that, a more accurate position
is picked when reporting an error.

Still in error reporting, the *Throw Operator* is also provided, so
grammar authors can control how a matching error will be reported in
certain places.  It comes with the burden of having to annotate the
grammar, and to pay attention to the fact that overly annotating a
grammar is to take less advantage of some PEG features provided by its
unlimited look ahead.

The general place where a *Throw Operator* would be desired is the
earlier position on an expression where it's known that a following
match wouldn't move the cursor. e.g.:

Consider the following piece of a grammar:

#+begin_src peg
  IfStatement <- IF LEFTP Expression RIGHTP Body
  AllStatements <- IfStatement / ForStatement / WhileStatement ...
#+end_src

The following inputs are examples of inputs that would unnecessarily
trigger the backtrack mechanism in the *Ordered Choice* of
~AllStatements~:

#+begin_src text
  'if x', 'if (', 'if (x'
#+end_src

Even though there is no path to a successful match with the above
inputs, and the *Ordered Choice* will still try all the alternatives.
With the *Throw Operator*, one can signal that no more matches should
be attempted and interrupt parsing right away if that one expression
fails.  e.g.:

#+begin_src peg
  IfStatement <- IF LEFTP^ Expression^ RIGHTP^ Body
#+end_src

The *Throw Operator* can also take an optional parameter with a custom
error message. e.g.:

#+begin_src peg
  IfStatement <- IF LEFTP^ Expression^"Missing Expression" RIGHTP^ Body
#+end_src

Note: the *Throw Operator* in the input language ~expr^l~ is syntax
sugar for ~(expr / ⇑l)~.

* Rambling
** Incremental Parsing

   The parser will fail at the first error by default (as Parsing
   Expression Grammars do originally).  But an incremental parsing
   mode is also included, but with annotation costs traded for
   precision.

   When parsing is done incrementally, the *Throw Operator* won't
   interrupt parsing right away.  It will instead add a special node
   to the tree returned by the parser storing information about the
   error.  The parser will then execute the *Recovery Expression*
   associated with the (implicitly created) label behind the *Throw
   Operator*, which should consume the input until where the matching
   of another expression can be attempted.

   The default *Recovery Expression* of a label of an instance of the
   *Throw Operator* is the following:

   #+begin_src peg
   #+end_src   

   Annotation costs come from the 

** Self Hosting

   What would it take to build a parser generator tool capable of
   self-hosting?  It can already take a stream of characters,
   transform it into a tree, and then it can take the tree and
   traverse it.

   There's now the need of emitting some code that could then be
   interpreted by the virtual machine that has been used run the
   parsing and the translating.  Besides choosing a format for
   outputting the emitted code, it will also be necessary to provide
   auxiliary tooling for introspecting the output stream.
   Introspection in the sense of reading from arbitrary positions
   within the output stream, and knowing where the writing cursor is
   (e.g.: for creating labels).

   So, before being capable of self-hosting, this tool has to be able
   to describe an entire compiler.  A first good exercise would be to
   try and implement something similar to what is described in the
   article "PEG-based transformer provides front-, middle and back-end
   stages in a simple compiler" (Piumarta, 2010).  langlang isn't very
   far from achieving that.  There are two main missing steps:

   1. semantic actions to allow transformations to be performed on the
      values produced upon matches.

   2. a modular output stream, that can encode values in different
      formats.  The backtracking of the parser is the reason why it's
      complicated to allow side effects on semantic actions.  Our
      options to deal with that are to either build an output stream
      that is aware of the backtracking, or to apply the output rules
      *after* matching with a classic visitor style.

   The initial format of the output stream can be text based, and the
   proof that it'd work is the ability to compile grammars into their
   correct text representation of the bytecode that the virtual
   machine can interpret.  There's some

** Pretty Print / Minifier

   Suppose we can parse a ~.ln~ file with a given grammar ~lang.peg~.
   That'd give us an AST as output.  One option is to write the
   translator as a tree traversal for that AST that emits code.  That
   will take one of those traversals per language that needs to be
   supported.  That'd double the burden on the user's side, since
   there was already the need of putting together the language
   grammar.

   In order to automate some of the process, one could maybe take the
   ~lang.peg~ file as input and produce a ~lang.translator.peg~, in
   which rules that *output* trees would be translated into rules that
   could also take structured data as *input*.  Take the following
   rules as an example:

   #+begin_src peg
   Program    <- _ Statement+ EndOfFile
   Statement  <- IfStm / WhileStm / AssignStm / Expression
   AssignStm  <- Identifier EQ Expression
   IfStm      <- IF PAROP Expression PARCL Body
   WhileStm   <- WHILE PAROP Expression PARCL Body
   Body       <- Statement / (CUROP Statement* CURCL)
   # (...)
   IF         <- 'if'    _
   WHILE      <- 'while' _
   EQ         <- 'eq'    _
   PAROP      <- '('     _
   PARCL      <- ')'     _
   CUROP      <- '{'     _
   CURCL      <- '}'     _
   # (...)
   #+end_src

   The following output would be generated:

   #+begin_src peg
   Program    <- { "Program" _ Statement+ EndOfFile }
   Statement  <- { "Statement" IfStm / WhileStm / AssignStm / Expression }
   AssignStm  <- { "AssignStm" Identifier EQ Expression  }
   IfStm      <- { "IfStm" IF PAROP Expression PARCL Body }
   WhileStm   <- { "WhileStm" WHILE PAROP Expression PARCL Body }
   Body       <- { "Body" Statement / (CUROP Statement* CURCL) }
   # (...)
   IF         <- { "IF" Atom }
   WHILE      <- { "WHILE" Atom }
   EQ         <- { "EQ" Atom }
   PAROP      <- { "PAROP" Atom }
   PARCL      <- { "PARCL" Atom }
   CUROP      <- { "CUROP" Atom }
   CURCL      <- { "CURCL" Atom }
   # (...)
   Atom       <- !{ .* } .
   #+end_src

   With that, we'd know how to traverse any tree returned by the
   original ~lang.peg~.  We could then build a general traversal that
   walks down the tree, printing out what was matched.

   There is one type of information that is not available in the
   original grammar though.  The specifics of each language!  For
   example, in Python, default values for named arguments aren't
   supposed to have spaces surrounding the equal sign e.g.:

   #+begin_src python
   def complex(real, imag=0.0):
       return # (...)
   #+end_src

   But that's not the same as in JavaScript:

   #+begin_src javascript
   function multiply(a, b = 1) {
     return a * b;
   }
   #+end_src

   To the same extent, minification rules for Python would be
   different from most other languages as well, given its indentation
   based definition of scopes.

   The good news is that most of these differences, if not all, can be
   encoded as options available for all languages, leaving the user
   with a much smaller burden of defining only the overrides for each
   language that demands options that differ from the defaults in the
   code emitter.

** Modules

   In langlang, modules are recursive containers for other modules and
   for grammars.

   +--------+
   | Module |
   |--------|
   | Rule1  |
   | Rule2  |
   | RuleN  |
   +--------+

   #+begin_src rust
     type Offset usize;
     type SymbolName String;
     struct Module {
       filename: String,
       // module in which this module was declared
       parent: Option<Module>,
       // modules declared within this module
       modules: Vec<Module>,
       // symbols provided by this module
       symbols: HashMap<SymbolName, Offset>,
       // symbols used in this module but declared somewhere else
       missing: HashMap<SymbolName, Offset>,
     }
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src shell
     $ mkdir -p ./lib/base                                    # directory structure for user defined grammars
     $ edit ./lib/base/rule.langlang                          # write a grammar
     $ llsh lib::base::rule https://url.with.test/case        # a file lib/base/rule.binlang will be created
     $ llsh -i. lib::base::rule https://url.with.test/case    # previous example worked because `-i./' is implicit
     $ llsh -i./lib base::rule https://url.with.test/case     # full name differs depending on where the root starts
     $ MODULE_SEARCH_PATH=./lib llsh base::rule https://url.with.test/case # search path can be extended via env var
   #+end_src

   When a symbol is requested, a look up to the symbol table is issued
   and, if it is present there, its address is returned.  If it is
   not, then the ~BinaryLoader~ looks for it within the bytecode
   cache, and if it's not there, it will go through each search path
   and try to find it in the file system.

** Error Handling

   Success

               Throw f
   <pc,s,e> -----------→ Fail<f,s,e>

   - inside choice

     #+begin_src text
     p / throw(label)
     #+end_src

     when ~p~ fails:
         -> log error tuple ~(location(), label)~
         -> run expression within ~R(label)~

   - inside predicate

     #+begin_src text
      !(p / throw(label))
     #+end_src
     
     when ~p~ succeeds:
         -> return label ~fail~
     when ~p~ fails:
         -> ~R~ is empty for predicates, so return ~throw~ doesn't do
           anything, ~label~ is discarded and the operation succeeds.

   Once an expression fails to be parsed and ~throw~ is called, a look
   up for ~label~ is made within ~R~.  If a recovery expression is
   found, it's executed with the goal of moving the parser's input
   cursor to right before the first symbol of the next parsing
   expression.

   Follow Sets

   An Expression ~e~ has a ~FOLLOW~ set of symbols that can be
   intuitively described as the list of possible characters to be
   matched after matching ~e~.

   1. Base Case

      #+begin_src peg
      G <- (E / ⇑l) "x"
      #+end_src

      The symbol ~x~ would be the only element of the ~FOLLOW~ set of
      symbols of ~E~.

   2. Recursive Case

      #+begin_src peg
      G <- (E / ⇑l) (A / B)
      A <- "x" / "y"
      B <- "z" / "k"
      #+end_src

      The ~FOLLOW~ set of ~E~ in this case is ~x, y, z, k~, since any
      of these symbols could appear right after parsing ~E~.
